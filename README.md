# AutoCAD

Based on a CAD and robotics course at uni. <br>

The sword was a cool project, but making the tip was funky, as far as I remember. Maybe it would have worked out better in Blender? <br>
**Warning** The sword movie folder is large(~900MB). <br>

Flags.dwg is my attempt at interesting flags
